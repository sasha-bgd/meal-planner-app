# 🍳 Meal Planner & Shopping List App

A web application that helps you organize your recipes and automatically generate shopping lists for your weekly meal planning. Built as my first full-stack portfolio project to learn React, Node.js, and database management.

## 🎯 About the Project

This Meal Planner app solves a common problem: **meal planning and grocery shopping are time-consuming and error-prone**. Instead of puzzling over what to cook, calculating ingredient amounts and manually writing shopping lists, this app automates the process.

**How it works:**
1. Store your favorite recipes with ingredients and instructions
2. Select recipes you want to cook this week
3. Automatically generate a shopping list that combines all ingredients
4. Scale recipes up or down based on servings needed
5. Check off items as you shop

**Why I built this:**
- To practice my full-stack web development skills
- To solve a real-world problem I experience weekly
- To create a portfolio project demonstrating React, Node.js, and database management skills
